🌤 Comfort Index Algorithm
The Comfort Index is a numerical score ranging from 0 to 100, where:

100 represents ideal and highly comfortable weather

0 represents extremely uncomfortable weather


📊 Weather Parameters Used

Temperature (°C)
Humidity (%)
Wind Speed (m/s)

🧮 Comfort Index Formula
Comfort Score =
100 − |Temperature − 22| × 2 − Humidity × 0.3 − Wind Speed × 2

22°C is considered an ideal comfortable temperature.

Larger temperature deviations reduce comfort more strongly.

Higher humidity causes discomfort and reduces the score gradually.

Strong wind speeds reduce comfort due to chill and disturbance.
