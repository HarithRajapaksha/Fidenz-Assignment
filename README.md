# 🌤 Comfort Index Algorithm
The Comfort Index is a numerical score ranging from 0 to 100, where:

100 represents ideal and highly comfortable weather

0 represents extremely uncomfortable weather


# 📊 Weather Parameters Used

- 🌡️ Temperature (°C)
- 💧 Humidity (%)
- 🌬️ Wind Speed (m/s)


# 🧮 Comfort Index Formula
Comfort Score =
100 − |Temperature − 22| × 2 − Humidity × 0.3 − Wind Speed × 2


- 22°C is considered an ideal comfortable temperature.

- Larger temperature deviations reduce comfort more strongly.

- Higher humidity causes discomfort and reduces the score gradually.

- Strong wind speeds reduce comfort due to chill and disturbance.
